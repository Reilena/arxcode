            <h2 class="my-3">The City of Khelgar</h2>
          <p>The elegance of their elven heritage is found in the majestic architecture of the snowy caves and ice
              structures they call their home. Rather than build more traditional dwellings to suit them, they have
              seamlessly shaped and become part of the harsh environment that surrounds them. They have embraced it,
              and wrapped themselves in the flowing white of their matron goddess in their attempt to make Aarandor,
              their home.<br><br>

              The center of the city is found inside a large cavern, close to the peak of the highest mountain in the
              new world. Buildings are part of the cavern rock, or have been shaped out of the ice that was part of the
              cave system the Faenor have come to call their home.<br><br>

              Trying to reach the city through normal means is next to impossible, exactly how the Faenor want it to be.

      <h2>Government</h2>
        <p>A body known as the Conclave of the Five, or just the Conclave or The Five serves as the government of the
            Faenor. It consists of the five High Lords of each House, with each member having equal power within the
            Conclave. Most decisions are made through a majority vote, usually after an extended period of negotiations
            and debate. The lack of interest in outside politics the Faenor are known for, is at a very high contrast
            with the marked interest in politics when it comes to ruling their people.<br><br>

            High Lord and Lord/Lady Heir - The title of High Lord is a hereditary one, passed to the firstborn of the
            High Lord's children, who becomes the Lord or Lady Heir, with gender playing no role, only the order of the
            birth. The Lord/Lady Heir often speaks for the High Lord if the High Lord is unavailable, and is able to
            represent the High Lord during conclave meetings. If the High Lord has no children of her own, then the
            next sibling is considered the Lord/Lady Heir. In the case that neither High Lord or Lord Heir are able to
            attend a conclave meeting or event, they're able to designate a member of the house to represent them for
            that particular meeting or event.<br><br>

            High Seat - While it's true that each Conclave member has equal power, it's common during times of crisis
            for The Five to appoint a High Seat, with the High Lord voted in often being the one considered to have the
            most experience with the kind of crisis being faced. The High Seat does not have any particular powers over
            the other members of the Conclave, but is responsible for organizing and moderating the agendas of the
            Conclave meetings. During votes, the High Seat usually offers their vote last, to serve as the breaking
            vote for potential ties.<br><br>

            General - The Faenor Unified Military is responsible for safeguarding the Faenor and are under the command
            of their General, who is chosen by The Five. The General does not have any governmental power and is purely
            responsible for the managing of the Faenor armed forces, and answerable to The Five. An elite group of
            knights serves under Faenor Military known as the Knights of the Argent Moon. Colloquially referred to as
            the Argent Knights, they were founded by Ralus Morinen with a mandate to hunt down and root out evil in
            any shape it appears. They are led by their Grandmaster, who in turn answers to the General during times
            of war.

      <h2>Ideology</h2>
        <p>Said to be favored by the goddess of Wind and Purity, Garwen, the Faenor have claimed the white mountaintops
            of the Volandis range as their home. They live in the coldest of places, with hearts that can be as icy as
            the lands they inhabit. Stoic and quiet, the other elves mistakenly think them to be passive. They are far
            from such.<br><br>

            When they strike, they do so with precision, leaving no one to tell the tale. When they speak, they say
            only whatâ€™s necessary. Their body language is as much part of the way they communicate as it is their
            speech. The way they look at someone, how they stand in their presence says a lot more than mere words
            would be able to convey.<br><br>

            Their distrust of outsiders stems from their belief that they've been chosen to safeguard the purity of the
            Elven heart. Garwen is the goddess of everything that is good and pure, and they see themselves as her
            children and heirs. Their choice to live in a land that most would consider inhospitable is not out of a
            desire to endure hardships, but simply to make it harder for others to reach them. In fact, they often go
            to great lengths to reshape their environment to suits their needs and comforts.

      <h2>Media and Real World Inspiration</h2>
        <p><b>House Arryn and the Vale</b> - Geographically, the Vale is known for being hard to access, a trait that
            is shared with the locations that the Faenor tend to claim as their home. House Arryn decision to not get
            involved in War of the Five Kings echoes the Faenor's desire to be left mostly alone by the other kinships,
            albeit for different reasons.<br><br>

            <b>The Malfoy Family</b> - Some of the physical traits found in the Malfoy Family served as visual
            inspirations for the physical traits of the Faenor. Their general elegance was certainly an influence in
            some of the aspects of Faenor culture, as was their dedication to purity. While the Malfoy family and
            Faenor embrace very different concepts of purity, the Malfoy family worries about blood purity, while the
            Faenor are concerned with the purity of the Elven heart, they're both staunch protectors of their
            respective ideals.<br><br>

            <b>Scottish Highlands</b> - From the Scottish Highlands we mostly borrow the concept of clans, adapting it
            to fit our vision for the Faenor kinship. The idea of the clan, or in our case the House being the major
            social unit drives some aspects of the Faenor theme and its government.<br><br>

            <b>Norse Culture</b> - The most apparent concept borrowed from Norse culture is the important of heroic
            deeds and the sagas. Some of the ideas found in Faenor Law were also inspired by Norse Culture. The
            indomitable spirit often associated with the Vikings mirrors the one shown by the Faenor in embracing
            some of the most inhospitable areas of both Larandor and Aarandor.

      <h2>Laws</h2>
        <p>The Conclave of the Five is responsible for creating the laws and their adjudication. Outsiders caught in
            Faenor lands breaking the law are often judged more harshly than the natives. Faenor caught conspiring with
            outsiders to break the law are judged even more harshly. Trials require at least three Houses to be
            represented by either a High Lord, Lord or Lady Heir, or someone designated by the High Lord to represent
            the house, this is known as the Judgment Council. A prosecution officer is assigned by the Judgment Council
            and is responsible for presenting the case against the accused. The accused is allowed to offer a defense,
            before the Judgment Council votes to find the accused guilty or innocent.<br><br>

            Lesser crimes often require service to the community, while serious crimes lead to exile. Those committing
            crimes serious enough to be executed, experience a harsher form of exile. They are blindfolded, given a
            simple robe as clothing, and taken out in the freezing wilderness and left there, with no resources, to
            fend on their own. They're branded as outlaws and are to be killed on sight by any Faenor.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="oneThird">
      <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Generally, the Faenor prefer to be left alone. However, individuals are known to venture out of Khelgar
            often, and some have even married into other kinships, integrating with their cultures.  In Larandor,
            they often avoided being involved in the politics of the other Kinships. The Eradication War changed their
            outlook some, however, and after the Third Migration, they've slowly come to accept that they must work
            with the other kinships if they expect to survive in the new continent of Aarandor.<br><br>

            Living in the icy mountain ranges of both Larandor and Aarandor has taught the Faenor patience, and this
            is an important a virtue to them as purity. Recklessness can easily lead to death in the snowy wilderness
            that they call of their home. This often leads other kinships to see them as lazy, lethargic or even
            apathetic, but from the Faenor's perspective the truth is far more nuanced. The Faenor feel the other
            Kinships rush into decisions without thought, that the others lack the long term vision necessary to master
            Aarandor.<br><br>

            Hunting is an important part of their lives, and Faenor usually do this alongside their Snow Wolves. These
            long lived wolves are more than just a pet, they are companions that young Faenor bond with, usually for
            life. Bonded wolves are considered part of the family, and mourned as such when they pass. They grow up to
            be large enough to ride, and can live up to around twenty years.<br><br>

            Heroic deeds are a very important to the Faenor and usually are recorded by loremasters referred to as
            Old Wolves in the form of sagas. Each House usually has at least one Old Wolf that is responsible for the
            sagas of that House. Sagas might not be completely historically accurate, and sometimes carry embellishments
            added by the loremasters. New sagas are often shared at the end of hunts or festivals, bringing Faenor
            together and often serving as a reminder of their place in the world. <br><br>

            The Faenor are also known for admiring beauty and elegance. While they are very pragmatic people, artistic
            pursuits are seen favorably, in particular if they honor the gods. Artwork and poetry honoring Garwen is
            highly valued, and this artistic bent has influenced the elegance often seen in the way they carry
            themselves.

      <h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
        <p><b>Flora:</b> The flora is is typical of cold weather regions. Higher up in the mountains, where is the most
            cold, one could find flowering plants, dwarf shrubs, grasses, mosses and lichens. Down the mountains,
            swatches of forests made of trees able to handle the cold are typical, like maples, red oaks, pine trees,
            evergreens and birch trees.<br><br>

            <b>Fauna:</b> Wolves and bears are quite common, usually sporting light furs. The Snow Wolves that the
            Faenor bond with are a very particular breed of wolf, and larger in size than the regular breeds. Hares,
            foxes, ox, and caribou are also quite prevalent.

    <h2>Stereotypical Faenor View of Other Kinships</h2>
    <p><b>Duindar</b> - Their dedication to the preservation of knowledge is admirable. Their ideas on how to rule
        themselves are strange, as not everyone is born to lead, but when they get lucky enough to have strong leaders
        they make for decent allies.<br><br>

        <b>Lorandi</b> - They think themselves the rulers, and  little do they know that all the others giggle behind
        their backs. We might share some ancestors, but those on their side were the ones lacking the foresight and
        patience to avoid the fracturing of the First Kingdom. We would have more in common, if only they took a moment
        to consider their actions. <br><br>

        <b>Aeran</b> - They are always wanting to move and go somewhere. They are a good example, of what not to do,
        how not to act, and why it is important not to rush into things. They would do well to settle down, even if
        only for an hour or two. <br><br>

        <b>Thalerith</b> - Ah, the savages. Their willingness to embrace their environment is to be commended, if they
        werenâ€™t so busy trying to get themselves killed by it in order to prove how mighty they are. While the Duindar
        at least try to enlighten themselves, the Thalerith make no real attempt to understand the world around them.
        They rather just smash it into the ground, which makes them useful when there common enemies to smash. </p>
